1
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:36,248
There are many stories in the history of our world.

2
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,785
Most are lost,

3
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:41,744
scattered in the winds of Time,

4
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:46,211
beyond the memory of man.

5
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,007
But this story.

6
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,535
our story

7
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:53,605
should not be forgotten.

8
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:06,007
Papa!

9
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:17,855
Maia!

10
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:23,719
Run! Maia run. Maia run!

11
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,792
We came from the water,

12
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:53,213
It runs through our ancient days,

13
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:56,960
down the long years to this moment

14
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,037
coursing through our lives

15
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:01,200
like the bloodline of Kings

16
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:04,623
A swiftly flowing stream

17
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:08,987
of memory and sorrow

18
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,254
One drop of water

19
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,668
of blood

20
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:16,728
and then another

21
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,209
can become a ripple,

22
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:21,601
a river,

23
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:24,340
a rising torrent

24
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,457
unstoppable

25
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:28,692
which in time

26
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:31,025
breaks down all resistance

27
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,128
to flow free once again

28
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:36,548
on the journey to it's destiny

29
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,053
The remnant of the faithful

30
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:42,447
The Dúnedain

31
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:45,585
the men of the West

32
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:48,444
were scattered and few

33
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:52,439
and beset by many dangers

34
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:56,355
For the Dark Lord Sauron

35
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:59,387
had not forgotten the past

36
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:02,535
and of all the peoples of Middle-earth

37
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,033
he held none with more hatred

38
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:08,479
and more fear

39
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:10,858
than the Dúnedain

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,661
He spread his will amongst his servants

41
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,281
and through the long years

42
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:21,745
sought ever to discover if the Heirs of Isildur yet lived

43
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:24,362
so that he might destroy them

44
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:27,165
and the last of his greatest enemies

45
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:29,200
would be lost

46
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:31,818
forever

47
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:53,257
Hurry!  Hurry!

48
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:57,393
Dírhael!

49
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,596
Ivorwen!  Gilraen!  Go!  Please!

50
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,762
I will not lose you all this day.

51
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:46,426
Arathorn!

52
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,801
You have my thanks sir,

53
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:18,555
and whatever service I and my family may provide you and yours.

54
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,978
We owe you our lives.

55
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,053
As I owe you mine. I thank you, lady.

56
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:27,602
You are most welcome, my lord.

57
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:32,083
We cannot stay here.  Where were you bound?

58
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:34,177
I do not know, my lord.

59
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:37,604
Orcs burned our village, and slew our people.

60
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:41,860
Those who were not killed were scattered, I know not where.

61
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,697
Dorlad, my son.

62
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:47,294
Struck down as he defended us.

63
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,865
We would not leave his body for the cruel sport of orcs.

64
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,217
Your son shall have a safe resting place, lady.

65
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,713
You will come with us.

66
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,055
Arathorn!

67
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,382
Arathorn?

68
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,646
You know him, father?

69
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:06,963
Yes

70
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,462
Or I did when he was but a child.

71
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:12,333
If he is the same man,

72
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,887
he is the son of my friend and kinsman.

73
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,333
Our chieftain, Lord Arador.

74
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,089
Isildur's Heir.

75
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,948
What is it?

76
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:26,153
They're after plunder, it seems.

77
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:28,467
But these are but baubles.

78
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:30,411
It is strange.

79
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,901
Orcs seeking gold and jewels in the Wild?

80
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,750
to what purpose?

81
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:45,273
You're becoming more like him by the day.

82
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,428
Is that what he would have wanted?

83
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:53,480
He would have growled at me for letting you take his place.

84
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:58,443
"The wild is no place for my daughter!"

85
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,970
But I'm still glad I trained you.

86
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:03,771
So am I.

87
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,067
Lord Arathorn

88
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,983
They'll bring no news to whoever leads them.

89
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,354
Good work Halbaron.

90
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:20,959
Now we must bring these three to safety.

91
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:28,458
We go to Taurdal, our village, Lord?

92
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,973
Dírhael.

93
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:32,061
My wife, Ivorwen.  And my daughter...

94
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,598
Gilraen.

95
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,088
And I am Arathorn.

96
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:37,747
Son of Arador.

97
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,160
Indeed.

98
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:43,184
No, no.  Do not bow.

99
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,285
When you come to my father,

100
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,119
you may greet him thus.

101
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:47,510
But for now,

102
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:50,886
we must make haste.

103
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:02,936
A jealous heart finds no room for true affection,

104
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,074
though it were standing right behind it.

105
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:09,220
What have I to be jealous about?

106
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,465
I saw that look between them.

107
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,885
Just as you did.

108
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,493
Your eyes deceive you.

109
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:18,910
Besides, it has nothing to do with me.

110
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,224
Does it not?

111
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:21,279
No!

112
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,758
Nor with you, Dírhaborn.

113
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:35,458
And so Arathorn and his rangers led the grieving family North,

114
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:38,774
past the mighty rivers

115
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:42,844
and through the vast forests of Rhudaur.

116
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,178
A land that still enjoyed the watchful eye of the Dúnedain

117
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:53,237
and brought them to his father, Lord Arador,

118
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:57,199
in the hidden settlement of Taurdal.

119
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:07,316
Come, my old friend and kinsman.

120
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:20,329
Let us bestow upon your son the peace and honour he has earned.

121
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:23,168
For I account your loss as my loss,

122
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:26,810
and your grief as my own.

123
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:06,051
Alas, no long sleep in ancient halls of stone

124
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:09,259
for a son of the House of Aranarth!

125
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:15,838
But I will not see your bones dishonoured, Dorlad,

126
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,730
when the servants of Evil try again

127
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,603
to drive the Dúnedain farther into exile!

128
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,515
Farewell!

129
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:37,375
I've come to ask your forgiveness.

130
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:43,936
Long had I thought your feelings for Arathorn

131
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:46,944
no more than a passing fancy

132
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:51,068
and that in time you would turn from them

133
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,703
and look around you at last.

134
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,176
I did not understand.

135
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,091
Until last night.

136
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,566
Years I have spent by his side,

137
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:12,226
yet there is a gulf between us

138
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,751
that only the flames of a stranger's pyre could reveal.

139
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:23,634
I cannot vie with such beauty and such sorrow.

140
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:31,458
El, any man would be honoured to call you his.

141
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:39,870
I would cause him nothing but grief.

142
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:37,980
We found these after the attack yesterday.

143
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,826
It is strange how such tiny things

144
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:48,563
can bring such immense darkness

145
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:51,123
and change into our lives.

146
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:55,770
Lord Arador now had much to contemplate.

147
00:14:55,805 --> 00:15:01,239
News of orcs assailing other villages came to his ears.

148
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:05,454
Peaceful homesteads, far from help,

149
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,278
were likewise menaced,

150
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:13,103
Taurdal filled as many of the Dúnedain fled their homes

151
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:16,663
and sought safety in numbers.

152
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:20,721
And so Arador led his brave rangers

153
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:24,086
in a quest to rid the land of the menace

154
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:26,258
that had ravaged his people.

155
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:29,614
Yet the most trusted of his men,

156
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:32,535
would not be at his side.

157
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,678
How goes the harvest, my lady?

158
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,669
Bountiful, my lord.

159
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,385
I had expected a little more for my travels.

160
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:07,346
Are you leaving?

161
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:12,089
My father has charged me to seek out the enemy's purpose

162
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:14,373
in the cold mountains of the East.

163
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,654
Alone?

164
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:16,762
Yes.

165
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:19,050
A dangerous mission my lord.

166
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:20,051
Indeed.

167
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:24,203
There was a time when such danger would not have moved me

168
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:26,941
and every part of my being would happily travel to the end of the world

169
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,705
in service of our people.

170
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,233
But now?

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,262
Now a part of me remains here.

172
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:40,468
And that is my heart.

173
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:42,639
My Lord.

174
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:44,548
I am sorry my lady, I did not mean to upset you

175
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:46,517
I will look to the East

176
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:48,494
and await your safe return.

177
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,212
My Lady.

178
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:57,094
With a heart full of joy

179
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:59,609
Arathorn travelled far beyond

180
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,860
the fallen cities of Arnor.

181
00:17:57,051 --> 00:18:02,764
While Arathorn made his lonely way into the cold mountains,

182
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,912
Gilraen would await his homecoming

183
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,732
in the fading summer of the West.

184
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:12,528
Straying at whiles deep into the forest,

185
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,153
to watch for his safe return.

186
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:15,796
Gilraen!

187
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,753
I will not go far!

188
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,054
Why does she do that?

189
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,884
You know for whom she waits.

190
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,364
She is too young.

191
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,020
But not without wisdom.

192
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,157
My heart forebodes Arathorn will wear

193
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,314
Barahir's ring sooner than expected.

194
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,131
Even so,

195
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,817
I do not think he will long lead the Dúnedain,

196
00:18:35,852 --> 00:18:38,142
once it rests upon his hand.

197
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:41,741
Then do not stand in their way, Dírhael!

198
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,121
For if these two wed soon,

199
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,425
there yet may be hope born for our people.

200
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,261
But if they do not,

201
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,445
it may be, in this gathering darkness,

202
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,917
that the Dúnedain fall at last,

203
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:56,241
never to rise again.

204
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:59,434
Let them have what happiness they may!

205
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:03,843
You're late!

206
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:05,260
Where are the others?

207
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:06,261
Slaughtered!

208
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:07,262
We were ambushed,

209
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:09,234
there are Ghostmen everywhere!

210
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:10,970
They are not ghosts!

211
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:13,202
Merely Rangers, you coward.

212
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:16,033
You're as bad as these two!

213
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:17,744
Did you get it?

214
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,530
These are useless.

215
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:34,618
You still have not found the ring that Sauron is seeking.

216
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:37,063
Go back! Find it!

217
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:39,852
How? There is not enough of us left.

218
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:42,276
We need time to increase our numbers.

219
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:48,476
It was a mistake to attack the ghostmen out of the darkness, Shaknar!

220
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:55,089
I do not make mistakes!

221
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:05,712
I go now to report your failer to Sauron at Dol Guldur.

222
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:11,156
Increase your numbers if you must, but send out your spies.

223
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:16,803
When I return I want to know where he is!

224
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:21,335
What is it?

225
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,015
I smell manflesh.

226
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,479
That's impossible.

227
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:26,335
Can't you smell it?

228
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,330
Arathorn!  You're back!

229
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:14,614
You should not come this far into the forest alone!

230
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:16,413
I know.  I

231
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:42,781
Rangers.  Will you not go to them?

232
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:45,026
They'll find us soon enough.

233
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,506
So, I must hurry,

234
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,050
or miss my chance.

235
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:51,760
For what?

236
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:06,331
I hope they take their time.

237
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:16,865
I train them too well.

238
00:23:20,972 --> 00:23:22,320
My lord?

239
00:23:28,456 --> 00:23:31,699
I wandered too far from the village.

240
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,542
But your captain found me.

241
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:37,700
I am at your service, my lord.

242
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:41,233
I shall always be at yours.

243
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:45,783
Halbaron, escort the Lady Gilraen back to the village.

244
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:47,368
At once, my lord.

245
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,584
Elgarain.  A word.

246
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:05,402
I'm sorry, my lord.

247
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:07,631
We could not find you. I did not know...

248
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,290
No apology necessary, my friend.

249
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,517
Have you ever been in love?

250
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:17,530
No.

251
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,305
It changes your world.

252
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,763
Consumes it with a burning flame

253
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:24,003
that does not abate.

254
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:28,582
A light as brilliant and piercing as Eärendil's star.

255
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:30,411
You have been in love.

256
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:33,963
I have heard it talked of.

257
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:48,268
So you are in love?

258
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,170
I am to be wed!

259
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,411
Or I hope to be.

260
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:55,259
And soon if fortune is with me.

261
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,483
I wish you joy, my lord.

262
00:24:59,622 --> 00:25:02,627
Your heart should be filled with joy, Arathorn.

263
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,270
Oh, it is...

264
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,800
yet I fear that Lord Dírhael will not willingly give his blessing...

265
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,403
Gilraen is, like you, not yet of age.

266
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:16,663
I may not have known love,

267
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:19,114
but I do know that when the heart would command the tongue

268
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:21,114
no man should stand in the way...

269
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:27,467
if you delay you may find that what should have been spoken

270
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:30,706
is forever locked in your heart,

271
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:34,411
and regret your only companion.

272
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:36,541
Your words are wise

273
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:37,849
still

274
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:40,986
The seasons are changing.

275
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,475
Maybe it will bring a change to his heart too.

276
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:46,994
If it changes with the seasons,

277
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:49,973
it can only grow colder.

278
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:56,348
Just hold your ground and speak your heart.

279
00:25:57,661 --> 00:25:59,261
Thank you.

280
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,924
You're a good friend to me.

281
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,478
I would lay down my very life for you.

282
00:26:04,918 --> 00:26:06,902
And I for you.

283
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,152
I am glad you're safe, my son.

284
00:26:31,187 --> 00:26:32,535
You also father.

285
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,559
Halbaron tells me that your campaign against

286
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,399
the orcs has been a success.

287
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,419
Their numbers are indeed few now.

288
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:42,420
They should not trouble us for some time.

289
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:45,910
Yet your mind is not at ease.

290
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:48,528
I now know what they're after,

291
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:50,872
and that they do not act alone.

292
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:53,517
They are servants of Sauron,

293
00:26:53,552 --> 00:26:56,090
and he seeks the Ring of Barahir.

294
00:26:57,374 --> 00:27:00,284
Father, they are hunting for you.

295
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,675
It is as I feared then.

296
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,152
I beg you to hide the ring.

297
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:05,416
Do not wear it!

298
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:07,037
No.
Sherif-Down.BlogSpot.CoM

299
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:09,138
But it will lead them straight to you!

300
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:12,598
Let Sauron send all the armies in this world against us.

301
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,640
I will not hide from who I am,

302
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,176
while I have a breath in my body,

303
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:18,456
and a sword in my hand.

304
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:19,490
Forgive me.

305
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:22,331
There is nothing to forgive, my son.

306
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:25,143
You have been of great service to me, and the Dúnedain.

307
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:28,783
You are a true heir of kings!

308
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:34,887
Come now, do not be troubled.

309
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:41,151
Your mother used to remind me

310
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:43,755
that the people look upon us for guidance,

311
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,319
that we had to stand fast, no matter what.

312
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:50,059
Perhaps one day

313
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:53,635
you will find someone with as much wisdom and beauty,

314
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,686
to counsel you.

315
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:04,069
You have my blessing, my children.

316
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:07,381
May your days be long and fruitful,

317
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:11,568
and filled with hope.

318
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,991
I go now to Rivendell,

319
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,432
where Elrond Halfelven awaits me.

320
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,425
When I return with his good counsel,

321
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:27,090
then perhaps we shall have a wedding.

322
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:33,111
Good luck with Dírhael.

323
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,956
Lord Dírhael...

324
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:01,557
good morning.

325
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:09,350
Through the long winter months

326
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:12,292
the warmth in Arathorn's heart

327
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:14,228
was only held at bay

328
00:29:14,263 --> 00:29:19,380
by his fear of failing his most important task.

329
00:29:24,152 --> 00:29:25,661
Just hold your ground,

330
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:28,651
and speak your heart.

331
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:54,749
Lord Dírhael.

332
00:29:57,986 --> 00:30:00,919
I have come to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.

333
00:30:00,954 --> 00:30:03,848
I owe you my life, son of Arador.

334
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,405
But I do not owe you my daughter.

335
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:09,521
But I love her, my lord.

336
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:11,085
I fear deeply the shadow

337
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,189
you cast on my house, Isildur's Heir.

338
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:16,214
The attention you show my daughter is unwelcome...

339
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:17,188
By you.

340
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:19,514
Not by her.

341
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:23,670
Yes.  Therefore it cannot be ignored.

342
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:26,862
I hope for Gilraen's sake

343
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:29,915
your father's blood flows through your veins.

344
00:30:29,936 --> 00:30:31,215
If you fail your people,

345
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,215
you will have only the Dúnedain to answer to.

346
00:30:35,755 --> 00:30:37,252
If you fail her,

347
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,798
it is me to whom you'll answer.

348
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:49,059
Was that a yes?

349
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:57,962
And when Winter had withdrawn it's cold fingers from the land

350
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:01,905
and passed into bright and early Spring.

351
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,562
Arathorn, son of Arador

352
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,034
and the Lady Gilraen were wed,

353
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:12,722
in happiness and hope.

354
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:21,406
But after only a year of joy,

355
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:26,048
a dark shadow crept back into their lives.

356
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,328
Arador, son of Argonui,

357
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:34,935
Lord of the Dúnedain, found himself in a shallow dell

358
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:41,245
amid the chill, blinding vapours of the Coldfells.

359
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,022
Run!

360
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,524
Run!

361
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:16,967
Where's my father?

362
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:17,914
He's further South.

363
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:18,380
Go!

364
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:56,795
Father!

365
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,550
Father.

366
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:14,363
Arathorn!  Arathorn!  Awake!

367
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:15,979
It is nought but a dream!  Awake!

368
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:20,806
No!  I saw him!  I felt the breath leave him!

369
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:24,958
Shhh!  It's but a dream.  A dream!

370
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:28,997
Oh, Gilraen!  Would that it were!

371
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,448
What hope is there for our people?

372
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,519
The line of the Kings hangs by a thread,

373
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:39,874
I fear it's going to find its bitter end in me.

374
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:44,310
Arathorn, where is your joy?

375
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:47,194
Where is your hope?

376
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:49,673
I will not despair!

377
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:51,923
Nor would I have you do so.

378
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:55,047
Arathorn, look at me!

379
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:57,186
Fear not tomorrow,

380
00:34:57,402 --> 00:35:01,190
for it is not ours to know or to command.

381
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,257
And do not fear that the royal house has reached its end.

382
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:07,905
It is alive.

383
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:10,554
In you.

384
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,761
And in me.

385
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,257
There is my Hope.

386
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:27,163
So a year after the lose of his father

387
00:35:27,198 --> 00:35:31,320
on the first day of the third month

388
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:37,672
Arathorn and the Dúnedain welcomed into the world new hope.

389
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:39,437
You have a son my lord.

390
00:35:39,864 --> 00:35:42,341
We will name him, Aragorn.

391
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:46,592
Kingly Valour, that he shall have,

392
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:49,664
but on his breast I see a green stone,

393
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,513
and from that his true name shall come

394
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:54,924
and his chief renown

395
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:58,586
for he shall be a healer and a renewer.

396
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:09,447
Behold Aragorn,

397
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:10,903
son of Arathorn,

398
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:12,438
Lord of the Dúnedain!

399
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:15,350
Scion of Elendil of Númenor!

400
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:18,998
The Heir of Isildur!

401
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,534
Hail Aragorn!

402
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:23,526
Hail Aragorn!

403
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:29,446
By the valour of the Lord and his Rangers,

404
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:33,095
the Dúnedain had a measure of peace.

405
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:39,401
And the child Aragorn grew swiftly and happily.

406
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:53,124
Halbaron

407
00:36:57,913 --> 00:37:00,338
Seems but yesterday that your son Halbarad

408
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:01,585
was Aragorn's age.

409
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:03,297
It does indeed, my lord.

410
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:06,105
I imagine it'll seem the same, Evonyn,

411
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,914
when our son is a man.

412
00:37:08,586 --> 00:37:10,330
That it will, my lady.

413
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:12,329
How quickly they grow!

414
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:13,706
And how much they eat to get there!

415
00:37:13,742 --> 00:37:15,284
If there's anything left!

416
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,269
I claim this field in the name of the King!

417
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,777
Seven stars and a crown on a field of blue

418
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:39,432
In the wind of war the banner flew

419
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,025
Around it the King called men forth

420
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:44,922
To fight for freedom in the North

421
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:47,841
Fornost has fallen the herald cried

422
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:50,290
As Dúnedain they fought and they died

423
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,448
A man noble and brave fell from his steed

424
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:57,218
Trampled by beasts that gave no heed

425
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:59,170
The king was carried from the fray

426
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,660
As the army of Angmar made its way

427
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:03,996
Our banner caught in a sea of death

428
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:06,884
As the kings herald drew one last breath

429
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,636
The banner toppled and fell to the Earth

430
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:12,685
The enemy howled in terrible mirth

431
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:15,381
As men ran in fear and cried

432
00:38:16,786 --> 00:38:21,944
The Lords Elladan and Elrohir of Rivendell arrived unlooked for,

433
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,581
and wished to speak with us at once.

434
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,329
Welcome, friends!

435
00:38:26,394 --> 00:38:28,394
What brings you to us this night?

436
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:29,826
And how fares your father Lord Elrond?

437
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,362
And the Lady Arwen?

438
00:38:31,169 --> 00:38:32,987
Our father and sister are well, my lord.

439
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:36,537
It was Elrond who sent us hither in haste.

440
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:40,514
Orcs are increasing North and East of Taurdal.

441
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,474
Their numbers are greater than have been seen in many years.

442
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:45,961
Even now they move relentlessly toward

443
00:38:45,996 --> 00:38:47,977
the northernmost villages of the Dúnedain.

444
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:49,981
It will not be long before danger

445
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:52,550
presses once more on your borders.

446
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:54,841
To Rivendell where the boy doth lie

447
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:57,488
And where the banner still flies on high.

448
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,326
For this reason our father sends grave counsel.

449
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,828
What is this counsel?

450
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:11,089
He urges you to send your wife and son

451
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,330
to Imladris for safekeeping,

452
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:14,508
and for you, Arathorn,

453
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,079
to lead the Dúnedain by secret ways to other lands,

454
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:19,911
and flee this encroaching danger.

455
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:24,089
It is late my lords, we will speak further in the morning,

456
00:39:24,124 --> 00:39:26,417
Let us find you somewhere to rest.

457
00:39:33,993 --> 00:39:36,535
Elrond Halfelven is wise,

458
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:38,058
and sees much that is hidden

459
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:40,206
or has yet to come to pass.

460
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:42,364
I will consider his words,

461
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:44,241
and take thought for my people.

462
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:46,385
Let your decision be not long delayed.

463
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:47,848
With every hour that passes,

464
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,239
peril draws closer.

465
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:53,584
I understand.  Rest well, my lords.

466
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:56,563
Rest well.
Sherif-Down.BlogSpot.CoM

467
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,473
Do not say it!

468
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,658
I will not be parted from you.

469
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,456
Yet it is wise counsel.

470
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,505
If danger closes in on us once again,

471
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,954
you and Aragorn must be protected.

472
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:16,995
All the Chieftains of the Dúnedain have been fostered for a time in Elrond's halls.

473
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:20,411
I myself spent years there as a child.

474
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:21,822
I will not leave you.

475
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:23,864
I will not!

476
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:53,934
We know where he is!

477
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,509
Good.

478
00:40:55,544 --> 00:40:57,127
Come with me.

479
00:41:03,871 --> 00:41:05,351
Elgarain!

480
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,559
Halbaron saw you leaving.

481
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,592
Something I should have done a long time ago.

482
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:13,759
Without goodbye?

483
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:18,655
Ever since your father's death,

484
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,595
I've made it my duty to look out for you.

485
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:24,531
I owed it to him for his years of service,

486
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:26,508
and his friendship.

487
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,860
When you wanted to take his place, I alone supported you.

488
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:34,328
For ten years you've been by my side,

489
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:36,881
yet now, when I need you most,

490
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:38,812
you would leave me?

491
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:41,080
You need eyes and ears in distant lands,

492
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:44,025
and the Ranger post at Hithlin is unmanned.

493
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,377
Hithlin?

494
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,232
But it is so far!

495
00:41:47,362 --> 00:41:49,844
I release you from your duty.

496
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,693
I will burden you no more.

497
00:41:51,728 --> 00:41:54,072
You have never been a burden.

498
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:57,886
Elgarain, you have only ever been a friend.

499
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:00,532
you're like a sister to me.

500
00:42:00,513 --> 00:42:02,765
You have a family.

501
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,849
A wife and son who need you.

502
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:06,786
Protect them.

503
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:10,135
Do not bid me stay!

504
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,874
Please.

505
00:42:14,513 --> 00:42:17,818
I will not hold you here if you wish to leave.

506
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:20,542
But I do not understand.

507
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:24,194
And for that reason, I cannot explain.

508
00:42:24,394 --> 00:42:26,648
Forgive me.

509
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,243
Lord Arathorn!  Your counsel is needed.

510
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:35,171
Arathorn.  The Enemy is on the move!

511
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,792
Safe journey, my friend.

512
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:59,298
My Lord.  The orcs are on the move.

513
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:02,002
Lord Elrohir bid me to say this:

514
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:04,962
"The decision has been made for you."

515
00:43:12,317 --> 00:43:14,567
Call my captains to me.

516
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:16,261
War is at hand!

517
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:44,707
Well met my friend.

518
00:43:45,617 --> 00:43:47,801
It is time.

519
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,048
But while the Lord of the Dúnedain

520
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:57,147
and the Sons of Elrond laid their plans,

521
00:43:57,182 --> 00:44:01,266
the orcs, by stealth and cunning,

522
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:06,112
were nearer to the village than even Lord Elrond had foreseen.

523
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:08,335
Did you not forget something?

524
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:10,986
What would I have forgotten?

525
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,566
To tell me you were leaving.

526
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,995
Lord Arathorn needs our help.

527
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,882
Yet whether he rides to Rivendell

528
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:21,602
or leads the Dúnedain to safety elsewhere,

529
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:24,475
you will not stay.

530
00:44:26,144 --> 00:44:27,342
I cannot.

531
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:30,991
I see that now.

532
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:33,386
I go to free my heart of him.

533
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:35,155
Would you not welcome such news?

534
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,315
Indeed I would.

535
00:44:37,362 --> 00:44:39,906
For you are ever in my thoughts.

536
00:44:40,198 --> 00:44:43,756
Did you never know or guess this?

537
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,381
You've always been kind to me.

538
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,378
Kind?

539
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:53,922
No, Elgarain.

540
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:57,906
I love you.

541
00:44:57,907 --> 00:45:00,432
I have done for years.

542
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:02,430
When you knew I loved another?  Why?

543
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,552
Because in time I knew you would be wise enough to let him go.

544
00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:10,695
And now I have.

545
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,964
Only to run from me.

546
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:22,165
El, do not run.

547
00:45:40,812 --> 00:45:42,649
Come with me.

548
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:53,417
I will.

549
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:05,216
Elgarain!  Flee!

550
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:06,790
You cannot hold them off alone!

551
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,350
Hurry, warn the village!

552
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:09,846
No!

553
00:46:10,323 --> 00:46:11,347
You must warn them,

554
00:46:11,348 --> 00:46:12,528
for the Dúnedain

555
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:14,744
go!

556
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:18,267
We will see each other again! Go!

557
00:46:30,557 --> 00:46:33,404
My lords. My lords!

558
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:37,051
We shall not wait for the orcs to make their advance.

559
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:40,386
We will evacuate the villages,

560
00:46:40,346 --> 00:46:42,910
but we will bring war to them in the Wilds,

561
00:46:42,922 --> 00:46:44,350
wherever they may be.

562
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:46,342
So let the servants of Evil beware!

563
00:46:46,343 --> 00:46:47,861
To arms! To arms!

564
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:50,021
To arms! To arms!

565
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:55,851
Halbaron!  Our enemy is upon us!

566
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:07,491
The forest Dírhaborn fights to delay them orcs everywhere!

567
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,990
Rangers, to me!

568
00:47:33,257 --> 00:47:34,811
Are you injured?

569
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:36,435
No.

570
00:47:37,249 --> 00:47:41,695
Gilraen, where is your son? Where is Aragorn?

571
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:52,810
Aragorn!?

572
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:05,645
Go to the Hall!

573
00:48:42,934 --> 00:48:45,714
Arathorn! Fall back, fall back!

574
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:27,366
There! He's the one!

575
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:31,518
Behold your fate.

576
00:49:31,645 --> 00:49:35,298
Your house has ended!

577
00:49:59,755 --> 00:50:02,324
Papa... Papa, papa!?

578
00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:10,474
Two dogs must die today!

579
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:55,211
Gilraen!

580
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:04,322
My lady, go inside!

581
00:51:04,357 --> 00:51:06,210
I will not leave you!

582
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,386
Papa, papa!

583
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:22,338
The Dúnedain prevailed.

584
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:28,898
But a heavy price was paid for their victory.

585
00:52:47,725 --> 00:52:49,610
Forgive me.

586
00:52:50,555 --> 00:52:51,865
For what?

587
00:52:52,682 --> 00:52:55,570
For my envy

588
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,533
because he chose you.

589
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:02,153
Elgarain!

590
00:53:12,574 --> 00:53:14,042
Arathorn, I...

591
00:53:14,077 --> 00:53:18,496
Save your strength my friend.

592
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,006
I failed you.

593
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:23,278
No.  No, you did not.

594
00:53:23,782 --> 00:53:27,436
My family is safe because of you.

595
00:53:27,383 --> 00:53:31,953
Your father would be so proud.

596
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:43,675
I found my heart today.

597
00:53:45,003 --> 00:53:47,208
And now it is lost...

598
00:53:47,235 --> 00:53:49,083
He was leaving with you?

599
00:53:53,866 --> 00:53:58,929
I will not lose it all.

600
00:54:04,737 --> 00:54:08,711
You must live.

601
00:54:09,784 --> 00:54:12,576
And Aragorn must live.

602
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:19,309
We cannot lose our hope!

603
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,264
Elgarain.

604
00:54:33,945 --> 00:54:35,385
Elgarain!

605
00:54:51,952 --> 00:54:55,427
How many more must fall?

606
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:58,571
How many?!

607
00:54:59,031 --> 00:55:03,935
Too long the servants of evil have ravaged our people

608
00:55:03,744 --> 00:55:08,154
and this once-proud Kingdom of Arnor.

609
00:55:19,563 --> 00:55:22,661
Men of the West!

610
00:55:22,665 --> 00:55:24,967
The Shadow grows longer,

611
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:28,134
and its cruel arm reaches ever toward us.

612
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,884
But we cannot lose hope.

613
00:55:33,277 --> 00:55:37,242
A time will come when the Dúnedain regain their strength,

614
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:40,691
and banish evil from these lands forever.

615
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:42,988
Until then,

616
00:55:43,888 --> 00:55:49,272
we have a duty to safe guard our people at all cost.

617
00:55:50,087 --> 00:55:54,007
So, arise, Dúnedain!

618
00:55:54,193 --> 00:55:56,471
Remember who you are!

619
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:59,938
Let our enemies once again flee before us!

620
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:04,159
And let no orc leave this forest alive!

621
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:07,832
Gather your rangers. You men with me!

622
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:23,223
I will come back to you.  I promise.

623
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:34,993
Then Arathorn, son of Arador,

624
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,067
Lord of the Dúnedain,

625
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:43,317
led his people in a great and valiant onslaught,

626
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:49,453
and the servants of the Enemy quailed.

627
00:57:30,149 --> 00:57:33,107
Arathorn, wait!

628
00:59:55,689 --> 01:00:00,799
Now the line of Kings ends!

629
01:00:04,043 --> 01:00:06,463
The line is not broken.

630
01:00:06,535 --> 01:00:09,186
There is still hope!

631
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,695
They will return, Gilraen.

632
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:01,993
They will.

633
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:07,875
Lady Gilraen!  Lady Gilraen!

634
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:10,673
Lord Arathorn is hurt!

635
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:26,333
Has he spoken?

636
01:01:26,368 --> 01:01:28,842
Only your name, my lady.

637
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:34,451
Gilraen?

638
01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:37,870
I'm here.  I'm here!

639
01:01:40,753 --> 01:01:43,922
Here is my joy.

640
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:49,528
And there is our hope.

641
01:01:50,214 --> 01:01:56,630
Aragorn, Chieftain of the Dúnedain!

642
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:53,833
Then the Lady of the Dúnedain bid farewell to her kin,

643
01:02:53,868 --> 01:02:56,770
and to all her people,

644
01:02:56,805 --> 01:03:00,833
for to protect the last children of Númenor

645
01:03:00,868 --> 01:03:04,530
she bid Halbaron disband Taurdal

646
01:03:04,565 --> 01:03:10,106
and the Dúnedain to find safety in small secret settlements

647
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:14,042
in the depths of the forests of Rhudaur.

648
01:03:48,562 --> 01:03:52,400
The Heir of Isildur was brought to Rivendell

649
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:55,704
for his fostering and safekeeping.

650
01:03:57,072 --> 01:04:02,876
And that is how you are come here to Master Elrond's house, little one.

651
01:04:04,827 --> 01:04:08,820
I will not for many long years call you Aragorn.

652
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,948
For your name must be forgotten.

653
01:04:12,483 --> 01:04:15,316
Less the enemy learn you live

654
01:04:16,003 --> 01:04:19,703
and all we fought for is lost.

655
01:04:19,992 --> 01:04:22,236
For the last time then.

656
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:26,767
You are Aragorn,

657
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:30,116
Son of Arathorn,

658
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:32,460
Chieftain of the Dúnedain

659
01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:36,890
and the Heir of Isildur.

660
01:04:37,347 --> 01:04:38,796
But for now,

661
01:04:39,707 --> 01:04:41,939
Estel,

662
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:47,052
you are simply our Hope.
